## About Diana Mwithalii

### Why I'm Applying
Finishing my undersgraduate studies is a big step for me but it's an achievement that comes with its pressure. My life is taking a new turn and the one thing I am sure about is that I want to pursue and further my career in full-stack engineering. Getting this opportunity with Tech Expert Academy will be the guide and start I am looking for as it perfectly aligns with my career goals.

### How I'll use the Opportunity
I'll use this opportunity to grow my skills, learn the industry standards, and help in solving problems. It will also be a networking opportunity for me.

### What it will have
Looking at it long-term, after growing my skills, I will give back to the community through mentorship and guiding others. I believe that developers thrive in a community and the support is really essential especially for those beginning or transitioning. Therefore, I will be part of the impact that gives back to the community.
